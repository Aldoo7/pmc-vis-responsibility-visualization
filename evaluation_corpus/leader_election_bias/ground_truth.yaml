model_id: leader_election_bias
description: "Unfair probability distribution favors process 1 in leader election"

bug_location:
  module: process1
  state_condition: "state1=1 & state2=1"
  line_number: 11
  component: transition_probabilities
  specific_element: "[elect] uses 0.6 instead of 0.5"

bug_type: incorrect_probability
severity: medium

property_violated: "Pmax=? [ F \"p1_leader\" ]"
violation_details:
  expected_value: "~0.33 (fair election)"
  actual_value: ">0.5 (biased)"
  explanation: "Process 1 has 0.6 probability advantage, violating fairness"

expected_top_components:
  - name: module_process1
    rank: 1
    expected_responsibility: [0.8, 1.0]
    rationale: "Contains the biased probability"
  
  - name: action_elect
    rank: 2
    expected_responsibility: [0.7, 0.9]
    rationale: "Action with incorrect probability distribution"
  
  - name: variable_state1
    rank: 3
    expected_responsibility: [0.6, 0.8]
    rationale: "State variable benefiting from bias"

repair_suggestion: |
  Change probability from 0.6 to 0.5 for fairness:
  Change:  [elect] state1=1 & state2=1 -> 0.6 : (state1'=2) + 0.4 : true;
  To:      [elect] state1=1 & state2=1 -> 0.5 : (state1'=2) + 0.5 : true;
  
  This ensures all processes have equal probability of becoming leader.

  Fairness violation through biased probability distribution.
  Tests ability to detect subtle probability errors affecting system properties.
