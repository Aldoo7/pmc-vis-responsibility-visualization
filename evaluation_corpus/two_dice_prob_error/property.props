// Properties for Two Dice Model
// Property that should detect the bias bug

// Main property: Maximum probability of die1 finishing first
// In correct model: should be ~0.5 (fair coin flips)
// In buggy model: will be > 0.5 (die1 biased toward early termination)
Pmax=? [ F "die1_decided" & !("die2_decided") ]

// Expected number of coin flips to termination
R{"coin_flips"}min=? [ F "done" ]

// Probability both dice agree on value 1
P=? [ F d1=1 & d2=1 ]
