model_id: gossip_asymmetry
description: "Asymmetric gossip propagation probability: node1 under-forwards"

bug_location:
  module: node1
  component: transition_probabilities
  line_number: 8
  specific_element: "send12 distribution 0.3/0.7"

bug_type: incorrect_probability
severity: medium

expected_behavior: "Uniform forwarding probability 0.5/0.5 among all nodes"
actual_behavior: "Node1 forwards with only 0.5 chance of success (0.7 branch sets inf2 while the 0.3 branch stalls) but biased ratio differs from intended uniform design"

property_violated: 'Pmax=? [ F "all_inf" ]'
property_type: probabilistic_reachability

correct_model_result: "Higher convergence probability (symmetric)"
buggy_model_result: "Lower convergence probability (slower spread)"

repair_action: "Change line 8 to: [send12] inf1 -> 0.5 : (inf1'=inf1) + 0.5 : (inf1'=inf1) & (inf2'=true);"

expected_top_components:
  - name: module_node1
    rank: 1
    expected_responsibility: [0.8, 1.0]
    rationale: "Contains asymmetric probability causing slow spread"
  - name: variable_inf1
    rank: 2
    expected_responsibility: [0.6, 0.8]
    rationale: "Source of gossip initiation"
  - name: action_send12
    rank: 3
    expected_responsibility: [0.5, 0.7]
    rationale: "Action embodying the incorrect probability"

expected_low_components:
  - name: module_node3
    expected_responsibility: [0.1, 0.3]
    rationale: "Late stage forwarding, unaffected by asymmetry"

evaluation:
  precision_at_1: "module_node1 should be rank 1"
  precision_at_3: "module_node1, variable_inf1, action_send12 in top-3"
  asymmetry_detection: "node1 responsibility > node2, node3"

debugging_difficulty: easy
representative_of: probability_errors
